* using bitwise operators to replace ‘/’ operator to perform divisions
* using the extraction of sign bit, exponent bit, and mantissa bit to 
  calculate results purely through integer type without using the in-build floating point type, (conforming with IEEE floating point representation)
* this function clearly reflects the logical operations performed through the computer circuitry
